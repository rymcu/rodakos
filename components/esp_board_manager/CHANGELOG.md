# Changelog

## 0.5.15

### ⚠️ Important Changes

- Load generated `board_manager.defaults` before project/user defaults when `sdkconfig` is absent, allowing user defaults to override ordinary board defaults while rejecting user defaults that modify Board Manager managed symbols.

### Bug Fixes

- Corrected the ESP-IDF version requirements for several version-specific configuration fields from v6.0 to v6.1:
  - `display_lcd` SPI `io_spi_config.flags.psram_dma_direct`
  - `lcd_touch` I2C `io_i2c_config.transaction_timeout_ms`
  - `periph_spi` `spi_bus_config.dma_burst_size`

### Features

- Updated **M5Stack Tab5** support to handle ST7121 panel/touch variant through runtime probing and board-specific setup.
- Added board support for **ESP32-LyraT V4.3**, including ES8388 audio codec and SD card.

## 0.5.14

### Features

- Added **littlefs** filesystem device (`type: littlefs`) with `flash`, `sdmmc`, and `spi` sub-types
- Added ESP-IDF v6.0 specific configuration fields. They are emitted only when building against IDF v6.0 or later, and a warning is printed (the field ignored) on older IDF versions:
  - `display_lcd` SPI `io_spi_config.flags.psram_dma_direct`
  - `display_lcd` I80 `bus_config.flags.allow_pd`
  - `lcd_touch` I2C `io_i2c_config.transaction_timeout_ms`
  - `periph_dsi` `flags.clock_lane_force_hs`
  - `periph_spi` `spi_bus_config.dma_burst_size`
- The `display_lcd` `parlio` sub-type now validates that the active ESP-IDF is v5.5 or later

### Modifications

- Updated **M5Stack Tab5** defaults with the ESP32-P4 chip revision options (`CONFIG_ESP32P4_SELECTS_REV_LESS_V3`, `CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_100`)

## 0.5.13

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed same-named board selection priority after the 0.5.12 board source metadata change. Later scanned sources now override earlier ones again, so `-c/--customer-path` boards correctly take priority over component and built-in boards.

## 0.5.12

### Important Changes

- Board scan/list output now keeps source metadata and groups boards by component/customer source, making managed-component and custom-board results easier to distinguish.

### Features

- Support for `depends_on` device dependency configuration. The `depends_on` field allows you to specify one or more prerequisite devices. During initialization, dependencies are initialized automatically. During de-initialization, shared dependencies are kept alive while active devices still rely on them.
- Built-in device sub-type entries are now registered with `type_sub_type` names through `ESP_BOARD_SUBTYPE_ENTRY_IMPLEMENT`, avoiding collisions between common sub-type names such as `gpio`, `spi`, and `i2c`.
- Support short `-a/--amend` paths under the selected board directory, for example `-a sub_board_800_480_lcd`.
- Add support for I80 LCD (`display_lcd` with `sub_type: i80`)
- Add support for custom button (`button` with `sub_type: custom`)
- Added full board support for **ESP32-S3 BOX2**, including GPIO expander, ES8389 audio codec, SPI SD card, I80 ST7789 LCD, and custom buttons.
- Added full board support for **ESP32-P4-EYE**, including PDM microphone, SDMMC SD card, SPI LCD, CSI camera, GPIO buttons, flashlight LED, and power controls.
- Added the `display_lvgl` example for initializing a Board Manager LCD device and running an LVGL test UI.
- Updated **M5Stack Tab5** support to handle both ILI9881C/GT911 and ST7123 panel/touch variants through runtime probing and board-specific setup.

### Bug Fixes

- Reject duplicate device and peripheral names when parsing board YAML, preventing ambiguous generated configs.

## 0.5.11

### ⚠️ Important Changes

- Added `-a/--amend` for board generation. The new mode requires a directory containing a `board_amend.yaml` manifest. Every file that should participate — YAML fragments, C sources, headers, `sdkconfig.defaults.board`, `Kconfig.projbuild` — must be listed explicitly in the `apply:` list. There is **no auto-discovery and no directory items**; the manifest is the single source of truth. Later list entries override earlier ones.
- Added support for `gen_skip` keywords, Configuring `gen_skip` for unused devices/peripherals in the amend file will skip the parsing and generation of those devices/peripherals during the board manager's build phase. Users need to be aware of dependencies and potential compilation issues.
- Added sdkconfig default override marking: when a later defaults source sets the same `CONFIG_` symbol, the earlier active line is commented with `BMGR_CONFIG_OVERRIDE`.

### Features

- Appended sdkconfig defaults in deterministic order: generated Board Manager defaults, base-board `sdkconfig.defaults.board`, then every `apply:` entry whose basename is `sdkconfig.defaults.board` (in manifest order).
- Appended `Kconfig.projbuild` in the same order: generated section, base-board `Kconfig.projbuild`, then every `apply:` entry whose basename is `Kconfig.projbuild`.
- Added schema validation helpers for board device/peripheral YAML fields, including warnings for unsupported fields.
- Added support for **esp32_s31_function_coreboard_1** board, supported devices includes:
  Codec and LED Strip

### Docs

- Updated `README.md` / `README_CN.md` and `docs/how_to_customize_board*.md` for the new amend flow.

### Tests

- Added `test_apps/components/test_amend_features/` (plus an out-of-tree `boards/test_amend_features_extra/`) and `test_amend_features_board.py`, covering happy paths and every documented error case.

## 0.5.10

### ⚠️ Breaking Change

- Added generic **lcd_touch** device support with I2C sub_type, and migrated supported boards from legacy LCD touch definitions. Code depending on the legacy `ESP_BOARD_DEV_LCD_TOUCH_I2C_SUPPORT` macro may be incompatible

### Docs

- Updated README quick start to recommend `esp-bmgr-assist` as the preferred setup flow
- Added `dev_lcd_touch_i2c` to `dev_lcd_touch` migration guides and an optional AI Skill for assisted migration
- Removed the prebuild script and related documentation; it is no longer a recommended workflow

### Features

- Added IDF-version based component source selection for peripherals, and updated RMT/MCPWM implementations for IDF v6.x compatibility
- Added I2C effective address tracking and query API for devices that support address probing or override
- Added **led_strip** device support with RMT and SPI sub_type implementations
- Added **rgb** sub_type support for **display_lcd**
- Added support for **esp32_s31_korvo1** board, supported devices includes:
  Codec, RGB LCD, LCD Touch, LED Strip and Power Control

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed resource cleanup and shared bus reference handling for several devices during init/deinit failure paths
- Fixed IDF v6.x I2S compatibility when the active target already defines `SOC_I2S_NUM`
- Fixed audio codec PA default pin handling by using `-1` when no PA control peripheral is configured
- Fixed PDM RX HP-filter config generation to emit HP-filter fields only when the active chip supports `SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_PDM_RX_HP_FILTER`

## 0.5.9

### ⚠️ Important Change

- Added a unified board metadata generation flow that produces gen_board_metadata.yaml, consolidating board devices, peripherals, dependencies and IO metadata
- Added runtime device config override APIs: `esp_board_device_override_config()` and `esp_board_device_restore_config()`, and updated **init**, **get_config**, and **callback_register** to use the effective runtime config

### Features

- Extended generated device descriptors to include sub_type
- Added or updated sdkconfig.defaults.board for several boards
- Added support for **esp_hi** board, supported devices includes:
  ADC Mic and PDM Speaker, LCD, GPIO Button
- Added global callback default log info

## 0.5.8

### ⚠️ Important Change

- Add preferred IDF action `idf.py bmgr` with the same options as `gen-bmgr-config`; keep `idf.py gen-bmgr-config` as a legacy alias
- When switching boards, back up the removed `sdkconfig` to `components/gen_bmgr_codes/sdkconfig.bmgr_board.old` instead of the project root
- Clarify the intended role of the YAML **`version`** field in Board Manager (schema / parsing contract vs. other meanings such as Component Manager `dependencies`)
- Emit **warnings** at generation time when an unsupported schema **`version`** tag is present (supported forms documented in README and customization guides)
- Keep `gen_codes/Kconfig.in` static for device/peripheral capability symbols only, and generate the selected board symbols in `components/gen_bmgr_codes/Kconfig.projbuild`
- Reduce maximum recursive scan depth from 10 to 3 across all scan paths, including default components directory, override paths defined in main/idf_component.yml, and custom paths specified via -c

### Features

- Reject mixing `bmgr` and `gen-bmgr-config` in a single `idf.py` invocation; reject board name/index as a stray positional argument (use `-b`)
- Support scanning board roots referenced by `main/idf_component.yml` local `override_path` / `path` entries for board-style dependencies

### Bug Fixes

- Use a resolved project path when deleting cached `sdkconfig` JSON after writing board defaults
- Unify project directory resolution for `idf.py -C <project>` and standalone `--project-dir`, so board scanning, relative `--customer-path`, and `bmgr -n` all resolve against the selected project directory
- Include `dev_fs_fat.h` and `dev_power_ctrl.h` in `esp_board_manager_includes.h` when the matching Kconfig options are enabled
- Add `#include "driver/i2s_common.h"` in `dev_audio_codec` for build issues
- Improve script error handling by exiting immediately when YAML parsing fails

### Docs

- Add **board_config_template** document, reduce the difficulty of adapting development boards, quickly obtain the required configuration

## 0.5.7

### ⚠️ Breaking Change

- Replace the board macro definitions from `CONFIG_BOARD_XXX` to `CONFIG_ESP_BOARD_XXX`

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where board manager configurations were not correctly reflected in `sdkconfig` in certain use cases, and enhanced the validation mechanism

### Important Changes

- Add sdkconfig consistency check on `-b` command, auto-fix mismatched symbols by default, remain skip flag `--skip-sdkconfig-check`
- Add sdkconfig consistency check on global callback, raise warning messages while mismatches occurred, use environment variable `ESP_BOARD_MANAGER_SKIP_SDKCONFIG_CHECK` to skip
- Additionally generate devices and peripherals symbols to `board_manager.defaults`
- Avoid `Kconfig.in` modifications, put the macro definitions of custom boards into `gen_bmgr_codes/Kconfig.projbuild` files

### Features

- Split the `adc_single` and `adc_multi` of the button in the file, keeping it consistent with other devices
- Support ADC Mic and PA-only speaker in `dev_audio_codec`
- Added support for `parlio` sub_type in `dev_display_lcd`
- Added support for `spi` sub_type in `dev_camera`

## 0.5.6

### Modifications

- Upgrade dependency `esp_video` to v2.0.0

## 0.5.5

### Modifications

- Rename `echoear_core_board_v1_0/v1_2` to `esp_vocat_board_v1_0/v1_2`

## 0.5.4

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a compilation issue caused by default `Kconfig.in`: when re-pulling the component and compiling, the default `Kconfig.in` may cause sdkconfig to be regenerated
- Simplified the script's `root_dir` selection logic, using the script path directly as `root_dir` to avoid potential issues that may arise from specifying multiple IDF_EXTRA_ACTIONS_PATHs

### Features

- Optimize sdkconfig handling: preserve sdkconfig if the target board matches the current board to avoid unnecessary re-configuration
- Clarify that the naming of the development board is based on the folder name, and add name detection to ensure that the name in `board_info.yaml` is consistent with the folder name after the board is determined
- Update csi camera compatibility, support configuring xclk, add ldo periph dependency, automatically initialize ldo when initializing the camera
- Optimize the custom device parsing script to support parsing nested configurations
- Add `board_name` validation, only allow letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_). If the name does not comply, this board will be unavailable.

### Modifications

- Reduce unnecessary configurations and files: delete the Kconfig file under the board path, and delete the board and chip fields in `board_devices.yaml` and `board_peripherals.yaml`
- Optimized the scanning logic of the development board, and instead of using the Kconfig file to determine whether it is the development board path, it scans three files: `board_devices.yaml`, `board_info.yaml`, and `board_peripherals.yaml`

## 0.5.3

### Features

- Added [`play_embed_music`](examples/play_embed_music/README.md) example to show how to use board manager to initialize codec and play flash wav audio file
- Added support for M5STACK TAB5, supported devices includes:
  Codec, LCD, LCD Touch, Camera and SD card

- Fixed an issue where the `pa_pin` configuration of ES8156 did not take effect correctly
- Fixed ledc timer parsing script error for `timer_sel`

### Modifications

- Change the output path of `board_manager.defaults` to `components/gen_bmgr_config/` to exclude it from git diffs

## 0.5.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the dev_display_lcd mirror_x/y and swap_xy configurations were not taking effect correctly
- Fixed compilation issue when the `sdkconfig.defaults` file not exists

## 0.5.1

### ⚠️ Important Changes

- Changed board defaults to use `board_manager.defaults` file instead of appending to `sdkconfig.defaults`. Board-specific configurations are now automatically applied via `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS` environment variable during build/menuconfig/reconfigure.
- Changed backup file from `sdkconfig.bmgr_board.backup` to `sdkconfig.bmgr_board.old`
- Use `dev_display_lcd` to replace `dev_display_lcd_spi` in esp_vocat_board_v1_1/v1_2, esp32_s3_korvo2_v3, esp_box_3, m5stack_cores3, dual_eyes_board_v1_0
- Use `dev_fs_fat` to replace `dev_fatfs_sdcard` and `dev_fatfs_sdcard_spi` in esp_vocat_board_v1_1/v1_2, esp32_s3_korvo2_v3, esp_box_3, m5stack_cores3, esp32_p4_function_ev, lyrat_mini_v1_1
- Add `dev_power_ctrl` device support for esp_vocat_board_v1_1/v1_2, replace `dev_gpio_ctrl` used to apply power
- Removed support for `dev_display_lcd`, `dev_fatfs_sdcard`, `dev_fatfs_sdcard_spi` and related test code

### New Script

- Add a new script `create_board.py` to simplify the process of creating a new board.
  This script simplifies the process of copying configurations from different peripheral and device directories when users add new boards, provides an interactive new board creation process, allowing sequential selection of chip, device, and peripherals. After passing the peripheral dependency check, the script automatically creates four configuration files required for the board.
  - Usage:

    ```python
    # Create a new board in default path: components/<board_name>
    idf.py gen-bmgr-config -n <board_name>

    # Create a new board in specific path:
    idf.py gen-bmgr-config -n path/to/board/<board_name>
    ```

  - Note: It is recommended not to run create_board.py directly as there may be path issues.

### Features

- Added prebuild script for convenient compilation
- Added global callback to auto-inject board defaults via SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS mechanism
- Supported `-D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=xxx` parameter with automatic merging

### Modifications

- Added support for IDF v6.x (trial version)
  - Added adapter for periph_i2s
  - Added warning for periph_rmt, periph_pcnt, periph_mcpwm, dev_display_lcd_sub_dsi (not supported by IDF v6.x yet)
- Refine sub device support for dev_button, splitting the sub_type `adc` into `adc_single` and `adc_multi`, splitting the `multi_click` configuration into `multi_click` and `click_counts`. Keep the enabling of `multi_click` and the specific number of clicks as two separate configuration items, consistent with the configuration approach used for `long_press_start` and `long_press_up`
- Modify CMakeLists.txt to fix the driver/xxx.h header file undecleared issue in IDF v6.x
- Renamed `apply_board_sdkconfig_defaults` to `generate_board_manager_defaults` for clarity
- Removed legacy methods for sdkconfig.defaults manipulation

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that find_project_root finding unrelated projects
- Fixed an issue where `CMakeLists.txt` generated on the Windows platform would cause compilation errors due to the `\` in paths

## 0.5.0

### ⚠️ Important Changes

- Board Switching Now Deletes `sdkconfig`: When switching boards, the script automatically backs up `sdkconfig` to `sdkconfig.bmgr_board.backup` and removes the original to prevent configuration pollution.
